This folder contains the code required to run the Data Visualisation segment in the Kiosk.

The main file to begin with is index.php

We save our data on a local server in a database (MySql).
And we use php to retrieve the data onto our Webpage.

Data Visualization charts have been inherited from Zingchart.
ZingChart provides better Data representation charts, rendered using Javascript.
It is a powerful Library, which helps you create charts quickly and easily.
